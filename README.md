# 🌙 EpiSleep

## 🌟 Project Overview

**EpiSleep** is a **game hub** built with a **retro HTML/CSS/JS base** to address various **Nuit de l'Info 2025 challenges**.

The purpose of this website is twofold:
1.  To meet the thematic challenges chosen by our team.
2.  To immerse users in a **retro** universe focused on the theme of IT and technological **resistance**.

The site unfolds through **5 distinct mini-games** which, between gameplay sessions, offer you an opportunity to discover more about this universe.

## 🕹️ Mini-Games & Challenges

| Mini-Game | Description | Main Challenge Addressed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Women and It** | An interactive module highlighting the importance and contribution of **women in the world of computing**. | Femmes et Informatique (Women and IT) |
| **Linux Install** | Discover the fascinating world of **Linux installation** (distribution, configuration...) in a fun way. | Défi de la nuit 2025 (The Night Challenge 2025) |
| **Ergonomics** | Developers usually work for a good interface, but here, it's the exact opposite! Welcome to the world of anti-ergonomics. | L'ergonomie (Ergonomics) / 🏆 Devenez le CTO de Votre Santé Posturale (Become the CTO of Your Postural Health) |
| **Mini-Game 1 — Decathlon Challenge: Rhythm & Animation** | A rhythm-based mini-game featuring a mascot bee performing dynamic workout animations based on the player's profile (Decathlon Challenge - Level 3). | Oh les beaux boutons / 🏆 Devenez le CTO de Votre Santé Posturale |
| **Mini-Game 2 — CVE Fishing: Security Meets Timing** | A timing-based game where you "fish" for vulnerabilities (CVEs), highlighting security concepts and the contrast between Windows/Linux vulnerability management. | CVE Explorer — Visual Threat Intelligence Challenge |

### Mini-Game Spotlight: Decathlon Challenge (Rhythm & Animation)

#### Concept
This mini-game was created as part of the **Decathlon Challenge (Level 3)**, requiring an animation-based experience.
The game begins with a questionnaire that determines the player’s profile. Based on the player’s answers, the mascot bee performs different workout animations (push-ups, lunges, strength training, etc.).

#### Gameplay
After the questionnaire, the game transforms into a short FnF-style rhythm challenge:
* Press the right keys at the right moment
* Follow the beat of a CC0-licensed song
* Enjoy custom animations and visuals tied to your choices

#### Notable Features
* Fully custom UI and character animation using CSS & JS
* AI-generated background, but all other designs drawn manually
* Dynamic behavior depending on player choices
* A lightweight rhythm-game engine coded from scratch

### Mini-Game Spotlight: CVE Fishing (Security Meets Timing)

#### Concept
This mini-game introduces cybersecurity concepts through a playful fishing mechanic.
Each “fish” is actually a **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**, each with its own rarity tier and description.

#### Gameplay
Inspired by Undertale’s attack bar system, the player must:
* Time their action to hit the correct zone on a moving bar
* “Catch” a vulnerability
* Discover a short description of the CVE and its associated severity

#### Objective & Message
By comparing the volume and danger level of CVEs, the game subtly highlights the contrast between Windows and Linux in terms of vulnerability management.

#### Notable Features
* 100% JavaScript-driven game logic
* Simple but effective timing mechanics inspired by classic RPGs
* Informative CVE cards that appear after each catch
* Rarity system to keep gameplay varied and engaging
